# distributed-coding-matnwb
Converting the “Distributed coding” dataset ([Distributed coding of choice, action and engagement across the mouse brain - DANDI Archive](https://gui.dandiarchive.org/#/dandiset/000017)) to NWB format using MatNWB conversion capabilities.

    * Convert Neuropixel electrophysiology data. Aim to build a function that can be applied generally to Neuropixel datasets that have a similar form.
    * Develop custom experiment-specific conversion code for behavioral data such as wheel position and lick times, and visual stimulation times.

INCF/Mathworks Summer Of Code project.
